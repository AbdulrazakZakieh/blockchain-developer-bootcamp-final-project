Zero-interest loan controlled by a judge Workflow:
1. A zero-interest loan contract is signed between three parties: Loaner, loanee, and a judge.
2. The loanee creates the contract and put with it the Ether value that will be held until he/she pays back
3. The loanee cannot get back the Ether held in the contract by themself
4. The loanee can release all the Ether or part of it for the sake of the loaner
5. The loaner can release all the Ether or part of it back to the loanee when he/she gets paid in real 
6. The judge can release all the Ether or part to pay the loaner and give the rest of Ether back, if any, to the loanee when he/she finds that the loan should be paid
